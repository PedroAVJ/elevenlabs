# Build, sign, and install the macOS menu-bar app into /Applications.
#
# Xcode's Run button is enough while developing. This script exists for the
# other case: replacing the copy in /Applications with a build of the current
# checkout, without losing the permissions that copy has already been granted.
#
# The repo ships a generic `com.example` identifier on purpose. macOS keys
# microphone and Accessibility grants to the bundle identifier and signature
# together, and keeps per-identifier Application Support state, so a build
# installed under a different identity is a *different app* to the system: no
# permissions, no settings, no enrolled voice profile, and a second ElevenLabs
# in the Accessibility list. Reusing one identity is the whole point of this
# script. It reads the same untracked scripts/local-identity.env the iPhone
# installer uses and never edits tracked files. When running from a Git
# worktree, point ELEVENLABS_IDENTITY_ENV at the main checkout's copy:
#
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=ABCDE12345
#   APP_BUNDLE_ID=com.you.ElevenLabs      # the iPhone app; see install-iphone.sh
#   MAC_BUNDLE_ID=com.you.ElevenLabsMac   # optional; defaults to ${APP_BUNDLE_ID}Mac
#   ELEVENLABS_SENTRY_DSN=https://...     # optional; observability stays off
#                                         # without it
#
# The bundle cannot be replaced underneath a running process, so ElevenLabs is
# asked to quit first and the new build is launched at the end. Quitting also
# lets it release the Continuity-microphone session cleanly rather than having
# it torn away.
