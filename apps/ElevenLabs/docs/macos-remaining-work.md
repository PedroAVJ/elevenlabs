# macOS remaining work

The adopted core Superwhisper/Wispr Flow parity set is represented in source.
The ledger names the behaviors deliberately excluded from ElevenLabs's
quality-first, ElevenLabs-Scribe-only boundary; the smaller unresolved candidate
set below is explicit rather than hidden behind a blanket parity claim.

What remains is acceptance and release engineering. Partial isolated UI
inspection is useful evidence, but it is not a full real-device run: the
system-owned Continuity surface, physical microphone release, and destination
apps' Accessibility and marked-text behavior can only be proved on the actual
Mac/iPhone chain.

## Deferred capability candidates

These are not claimed as implemented. They are narrower than the excluded
automation/model/media-control surfaces, but still need product or release work:

- Opt-in macOS notifications for a background failure or newly held output when
  the capture indicator is no longer visible. Authorization, categories, and
  delivery should be tested only after the permanent signed bundle identity
  exists.
- Removing a large retained-audio library without ever waiting behind an
  in-progress copy on the main actor. The current lock preserves consistency,
  but a worst-case privacy-toggle cleanup can temporarily make the UI
  unresponsive.

## Automated candidate gates

- [ ] Run the complete focused Swift test suite, including delivery-time editor
      replacement/retargeting, no-focused-editor clipboard fallback, ambiguous
      insertion no-retry behavior, Paste accelerator casing, glyph compatibility,
      persistence failure, pending-audio, pending-transcript ambiguity, Command
      gesture/input mode, vocabulary boundary, retained-audio quota/free-space,
      and single-instance coverage.
- [ ] Build `ElevenLabsMac` from a clean candidate checkout with the documented
      ad-hoc command. Review every warning and confirm the generated app contains
      the intended sources and no credential or local state.
- [ ] Recheck the ElevenLabs multipart body: `scribe_v2` only; no redirects;
      repeated `keyterms` fields; at most 1,000 terms; 49 characters accepted
      and 50 rejected; no more than five words; forbidden characters rejected.
- [ ] Prove that dynamic app/caret context receives keyterm slots before global
      vocabulary when the combined list reaches 1,000.
- [ ] Run storage tests on malformed, future-schema, symlinked, unreadable, and
      write-failing documents. Each store must preserve bytes and fail closed,
      not publish state it could not commit.
- [ ] Run the product-wide lease test with two normal app processes using
      different bundle identifiers. Also cover a running legacy ElevenLabs build
      that predates the lease. The secondary process must not initialize or
      change shared defaults, History, recovery journals, or retained audio.

## Isolated macOS UI acceptance

Use a disposable build compiled with `ELEVENLABS_UI_TEST_INSTANCE`, a unique
bundle identifier, redirected `CFFIXED_USER_HOME`/`TMPDIR`, and a non-secret
placeholder API key. Do not point this run at the installed app's Keychain,
TCC grants, or Application Support.

- [ ] For both the Mac and iPhone source, play media before recording. Confirm
      it keeps advancing while output eases 12 dB down over 400 ms and returns
      over 900 ms on pause, End, Escape, error, sleep, disconnect, and Quit.
      Reverse start/stop rapidly without a jump. Change volume manually during
      capture and confirm ElevenLabs yields. Force-quit during fade and restore,
      then relaunch and confirm the original channel map returns. Disconnect the
      faded output, relaunch, reconnect it, and confirm restoration follows that
      device without touching the new default. Unsupported outputs must keep
      playing unchanged.

- [ ] Complete and revisit every onboarding step. Check API-key states,
      permission/readiness explanations, microphone selection/test, shortcuts,
      successful-audio disclosure, and the language menu.
- [ ] Launch with no saved windows and confirm ElevenLabs appears only in the
      menu bar, not the Dock or Command-Tab. Open the dashboard, then Settings,
      and confirm regular app presence persists until both close. Confirm closing
      the last real window returns to menu-bar-only presence without flicker.
      Trigger the HUD and global right-Command shortcut with no real window open;
      neither may promote the app or depend on the menu being open.
- [ ] Select Auto and several entries near the beginning, middle, and end of the
      full 100-choice language catalog, then relaunch and confirm persistence.
      Inject a low-confidence Auto response and confirm the text is preserved
      while the detected-language review warning appears.
- [ ] Exercise the capture indicator at top, bottom, left, and right. Confirm the
      active display is chosen correctly, the pill stays click-through, and no
      state clips at normal accessibility text sizes. From the menu-bar panel,
      choose Move HUD, drag the capsule to several arbitrary positions and a
      second display, then choose Done Moving HUD. Confirm the exact position
      survives an app relaunch, normal HUD states are click-through again, and
      choosing a fixed Placement clears the custom position.
- [ ] Exercise Connecting, Listening, Releasing, Resting, and Draining. Confirm
      the native Liquid Glass surface is used on macOS 26 and the single capsule
      stays wordless. Confirm the Mac start shows a brief neutral laptop glyph,
      the iPhone start holds a neutral phone with an amber breathing wait-dot
      until capture is actually live, and both resolve into the centered real
      voice waveform with fast attack and slower release. Dictate several rapid
      segments and confirm they never create cards, rails, slivers, counts, or
      badges: the capsule keeps one identity for the whole dictation. Pause and
      confirm the actual waveform freezes in place, gray and sourceless, without
      timing out. Press fn and confirm it morphs directly into the small typing
      dots with no gray intermediate; only verified delivery may pop it outward.
      Before it lands, press fn again and confirm the dots and patter stop, the
      same compact capsule becomes a steady amber raised hand, and it remains
      there for several minutes while transcription continues. Confirm it cannot
      be confused with the wide frozen Resting waveform. Press fn from Held and
      confirm the same face returns to dots and lands once at the cursor focused
      then. Reopen while draining or Held and confirm the same capsule stands back up into the
      live waveform. Press Escape from hot, resting, draining, and Held and confirm the
      capsule folds inward while all owed text moves to recovery. The indicator
      must hide at idle, after delivery, and for success, errors, and offline
      state; it must never become an error notification. Force a held
      chunk and confirm one count-free clipboard glyph appears only while the
      hold owns the private live pasteboard claim, changes to a neutral document
      glyph after another app replaces the clipboard, and disappears within two
      seconds. Relaunch with waiting or uncertain recovery entries and confirm
      none are replayed into the HUD; the dashboard remains authoritative. Hold the
      Mac start pending and confirm the laptop beat hides after 0.5 seconds;
      hold iPhone Connecting and Releasing and confirm those faces hide no later
      than 20 and 15 seconds after the phases began, respectively. Keep one request transcribing and confirm its
      card hides after 90 continuously visible seconds — without hiding
      younger cards — while the dashboard and menu bar continue to report the
      real work state. With Reduce Motion enabled, confirm state changes become
      restrained crossfades without scale travel and without losing state
      clarity.
- [ ] Dictate three rapid chunks into one field and confirm delivery remains in
      spoken order even when Scribe completes them out of order. Verify every
      seam against the live caret: words get exactly one needed space,
      punctuation attaches, existing spaces/newlines do not gain another, and a
      sentence-ending mark gives the next ordinary chunk sensible casing.
- [ ] Start a dictation in one editor, then focus a different writable field or
      application before transcription completes. Confirm the transcript is
      fitted to and delivered into the editor that owns focus at the delivery
      boundary, without requiring the record-start AX node or application.
      Repeat while an Electron or Chromium editor rebuilds or replaces its AX
      tree and editable node; the current writable editor must still qualify.
- [ ] Move focus to a noneditable control before delivery and seed older recovery
      entries. Confirm no insertion is attempted, the exact newest transcript
      becomes the clipboard fallback, the dashboard keeps every unresolved entry,
      and the HUD remains a transient status rather than a queue counter. Use the
      explicit release command from another writable editor and confirm the
      delayed text is fitted to that current cursor.
- [ ] Force an insertion whose side effect cannot be confirmed. Confirm the exact
      transcript remains recoverable and clipboard-backed, is marked possibly
      delivered, and is never retried automatically. A later explicit Paste
      Anyway must require a fresh one-shot authorization for the reviewed queue.
- [ ] Dictate three segments, pausing between them, and confirm nothing reaches
      the cursor at any pause. Press fn and confirm all three arrive at once, in
      spoken order. Confirm the End after a long pause is effectively instant,
      because pausing already started transcription.
- [ ] With VoiceOver, confirm capture, rest, draining, user-controlled Held,
      the separate recovery-held receipt, delivery, and
      dismissal announcements describe the consequential phase without exposing
      internal segment ordinals. With Reduce Motion, confirm pop and fold become
      restrained crossfades rather than scale travel.
- [ ] On MacBook speakers at low volume, confirm the iPhone wait tick is low and
      level, capture-live gets one rising ping with no load delay, pause gets the
      low held tone, and Escape gets the muted fold tone. Confirm fn itself is
      silent, the low irregular typing patter runs only while the dots are up,
      and the falling delivery plop plays only after verified insertion. While
      Draining, press fn and confirm the patter stops and two dry level knocks
      announce Held without resembling the single low pause tone; release from
      Held should restart the patter without another chime. Confirm
      errors use the only two-note phrase, E4 to B3 low and falling, and disabling
      Sounds silences the complete family.
- [ ] Verify every vocabulary action: add, search, edit Save/Cancel, paste-list
      Save/Cancel, file-picker Cancel, and remove confirm/Cancel. Check the
      1,000-term ceiling, fewer-than-50-character and five-word limits, forbidden
      characters, duplicate handling, and the 20% / over-100 billing disclosure.
- [ ] Verify every replacement and per-app-rule action, including validation,
      enabled state, auto-send warning, Save/Cancel, and delete confirm/Cancel.
- [ ] With an empty profile, switch History through Never store, 1, 7, 30, 90,
      and Forever. Confirm Never store produces no false persistence error,
      successful-audio controls disable appropriately, and Delete All is disabled
      when there is nothing to delete.
- [ ] Seed disposable History records and retained audio. Exercise search, Play,
  Stop, Edit Save/Cancel, per-record delete confirm/Cancel, Delete All
  confirm/Cancel, Process Again, and Process Again cancellation. During
  reprocessing, actions that could race the record must stay disabled.
- [ ] Seed referenced legacy WAV History copies and verify launch migration to
  AAC/M4A preserves every transcript, Play, Process Again, private permissions,
  and crash recovery at each file/reference handoff boundary.
- [ ] Fill retained History audio to the 1 GiB quota and simulate the 2 GiB
      free-space reserve boundary. In both cases the transcript must remain saved,
      the optional audio omission must be visible, and existing retained files
      must remain usable.

## Delivery-crash and Never-store acceptance

Run these in a disposable profile with fault injection around each durable
write. Inspect the files after every restart rather than trusting the UI alone.

- [ ] Under each History retention mode, prove the transcript enters the durable
      pending-delivery escrow before source-audio proof is retired and before
      external output. Then finish a Never-store dictation and prove that after
      resolved delivery no completed History row or successful-audio copy remains.
- [ ] Fail escrow creation. The transcript must not paste; History and recovery
      audio must remain available with a visible explanation. Copy/Paste Last
      must remain blocked; History Copy may proceed only after it repairs that
      exact escrow and retires the source-audio retry path.
- [ ] Fail the transition to `deliveryUncertain`. External paste must be blocked
      and the text must remain recoverable.
- [ ] Terminate after `deliveryUncertain` is durable and before cleanup. Relaunch
      must label the entry possibly delivered, refuse automatic/hotkey retry, and
      offer Copy, Discard, or a separately confirmed one-shot Paste Anyway arm.
      Arming from the dashboard must not paste into ElevenLabs; it must require
      returning to the destination and pressing the release shortcut.
- [ ] Exercise a definite no-paste result and prove only entries that were
      originally pending return to pending. An entry recovered as uncertain must
      never be silently downgraded to safe-to-retry.
- [ ] Exercise confirmed and unverified paste results, then force recovery-entry
      deletion failure. Confirmed output with failed cleanup must remain visibly
      uncertain; unverified output must never be replayed automatically.
- [ ] Hold a pasteboard-backed delivery open while attempting Copy on a different
      History/held transcript. The explicit copy must wait or fail without
      replacing the text the destination is consuming, and no escrow may resolve
      until its own clipboard write succeeds.
- [ ] Seed two source-linked History rows for one pending-audio identifier. Launch
      must queue only the completion-marker row when one is durable (otherwise
      the newest row), suppress Retry for that audio, and preserve the
      noncanonical History row without allowing a joined duplicate. If a sibling
      is marked possibly delivered, that warning must move atomically onto the
      canonical row before the sibling handoff is retired.

## Direct physical Mac and iPhone acceptance

Run this with a signed candidate, a paired iPhone, Notes, and at least one opaque
Electron or browser text field. Record screen/video plus privacy-safe diagnostics
for the release evidence.

- [ ] Grant permissions through onboarding, select the Continuity microphone,
      and complete the three-second microphone test.
- [ ] Confirm a bare **fn** tap is usable as a global control at all. Depending
      on the System Settings "Press 🌐 to" choice, the same tap may also change
      input source, open the emoji picker, or start system dictation; the
      modifier is passed through, so ElevenLabs cannot suppress that. If fn is
      unusable, move the End verb to right ⇧ — one constant in
      `MacDictationKey` and its `MacModifierSide` bit — and change nothing else.
- [ ] Focus a Notes field, tap bare right ⌘, wait for **Listening**, dictate,
      then tap **fn**. Keep that writable field focused through the delivery
      boundary and confirm text reaches the current cursor while the iPhone's
      system-owned capture surface dismisses before transcription.
- [ ] Repeat, but press **fn** again while the HUD is Draining. Confirm the HUD
      becomes Held and stays there for several minutes while transcription may
      finish. Switch windows and click into a different writable field, then
      press **fn**: the complete dictation must land exactly once at that
      then-current cursor. Repeat from Held with Escape and confirm every banked
      segment reaches waiting-text recovery with nothing pasted or destroyed.
      Repeat from Held with each source key and confirm the same dictation
      reopens, accepts another segment, and later delivers once with no loss or
      duplicate. Open the menu-bar map in Draining and Held and confirm fn shows
      different hold and deliver glyphs while both source keys and Escape retain
      their documented verbs.
- [ ] Repeat immediately to prove clean Continuity release and reconnect, not
      merely one successful transcription.
- [ ] Tap right ⌥ from idle and confirm the iPhone microphone is used without
      any stored mode being consulted. Quit, relaunch, tap right ⌘, and confirm
      the Mac microphone is used — no source may survive a launch.
- [ ] While recording on the Mac, tap right ⌘ once. Confirm the microphone is
      released, the segment banks, the HUD waveform freezes in place, dim, and
      **sourceless**, and nothing is delivered. Leave it resting for several
      minutes and confirm the capsule never times out while the banked segment
      continues transcribing invisibly.
- [ ] From that resting state tap right ⌥. Confirm iPhone Connecting then
      Listening begins as the next ordered segment. Tap fn and confirm both
      segments are delivered in spoken order. Repeat in the opposite direction.
- [ ] While speaking through the Mac, tap right ⌥. Confirm nothing switches,
      nothing is delivered, and the HUD shows only the wrong-source nudge.
      Repeat in the opposite direction, and again during Connecting rather
      than Recording — a capture exists from the moment one is acquired, so
      neither source key may start anything there either.
- [ ] While connecting and while recording, press Escape once. Each must discard
      the live segment, release the microphone, and leave no capture indicator
      behind — landing on the safe floor: resting when earlier segments are
      banked, idle when none are.
- [ ] Press Escape from a resting dictation. Confirm nothing is pasted, the
      dictation closes, and its transcribed text appears in the dashboard's
      waiting-text list rather than being destroyed.
- [ ] While connecting with nothing banked, press fn and confirm it is inert.
      Repeat with an earlier segment banked and confirm fn aborts the connection
      and delivers what was banked.
- [ ] Open the menu-bar panel and confirm it draws your physical keyboard shape
      (ANSI, ISO, or JIS), that exactly four keys carry glyphs, that they
      re-glyph as the state changes, and that opening it never adds a Dock icon
      or Command-Tab entry.
- [ ] Start in one writable field and switch to another field or application
      before the response returns. Confirm the current delivery-time editor
      receives the text. Repeat in Electron or Chromium while its AX tree or
      editable node is replaced; record-start node identity must not be required.
- [ ] Repeat with no writable editor focused. Confirm no insertion occurs and the
      exact newest transcript is the clipboard fallback even with older recovery
      entries. Then explicitly release delayed text into a current writable
      editor rather than waiting for an archived node to return.
- [ ] Repeat in an opaque field. An unverifiable paste must be labelled
      unconfirmed/possibly delivered, remain recoverable and clipboard-backed,
      and never insert a second copy automatically.
- [ ] Exercise an unavailable/disconnected microphone, device reconnect,
      mid-stream loss with partial salvage, secure input, revoked permissions,
      sleep/wake, and the 20-minute automatic stop path.
- [ ] Exercise forced offline/timeout/429/5xx failures, automatic reconnect
      retry, manual retry, discard, imported audio, paste/copy last,
      clipboard-only and type-out app rules, clipboard restoration, and guarded
      auto-send.
- [ ] Quit normally during capture and confirm the microphone is released and the
      finalized audio is waiting after relaunch. Terminate disposable candidates
      during capture, upload, History commit, and delivery bookkeeping; each
      restart must produce one recoverable item and no unattended duplicate.
- [ ] Launch a second normal candidate while the first is active. It must bring
      forward the owner or exit with the safety explanation, never show a second
      recorder or mutate shared data.

Until every applicable box above has recorded evidence, describe the parity
implementation as source/build/logic tested only to the degree actually run —
not fully end-to-end verified.

## Repository-owner release work

These items are genuinely unimplemented because they require product identity,
credentials, and distribution decisions that this source pass cannot make:

- [ ] Choose the final product name. "ElevenLabs" is a working title; reuse of
      "Near" was considered and rejected because that name is parked with the
      Clockwork hardware direction. Rename the display name together with the
      permanent bundle-identifier work below.
- [ ] Design the real app icon to replace the placeholder mic artwork in the
      shared `ElevenLabs/Assets.xcassets` catalog (used by both the iPhone and
      macOS targets). It should be full-bleed in the macOS squircle and legible
      at 16 px; direction is open until the name is chosen.
- [ ] As part of the same branding pass, decide whether the menu bar item's
      idle glyph stays a system SF Symbol (`waveform` today) or becomes a
      custom monochrome template glyph matching the brand. The menu bar item
      itself stays: it bootstraps login-item launches when no window opens and
      is the persistent state surface after HUD cards time out. The non-idle
      state symbols (recording, error, offline, setup needed) keep their
      system-semantic forms either way.
- [ ] Choose the permanent macOS bundle identifier and Apple Developer team.
- [ ] Configure the release entitlements, Developer ID signing, hardened runtime,
      versioning, notarization, and stapling; then repeat the physical acceptance
      run with that exact artifact because TCC and Keychain behavior follow its
      code identity.
- [ ] Choose and implement an update channel. If Sparkle is selected, protect the
      signing key, host the appcast, and test a real update and rollback. Do not
      expose an inert **Check for Updates** control before the channel exists.
- [ ] Archive the final acceptance evidence and publish only the notarized,
      stapled artifact that produced it.
